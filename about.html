            <h1 style="background-color: aquamarine;">About Me</h1>
            <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">In May of 2015 I had just become a high school graduate. Like many others who graduate high school, college or getting a job is more than likely the next step. I had decided to go straight into college at Kennesaw State University. I had about half classes online, one class on Kennesaw campus, and one on the Marietta campus. I completed about a semester and a half before I decided school was not for me, so I dropped out and joined the military.</p>
            <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">The military is something that I knew I wanted to do since I was a child. With that being said, dropping out of college and joining the Army was an easy decision for me. Spent about half my time as active duty overseas in places like South Korea, Bulgaria, and Romania. I spent the other half state side in the reserves. Then I decided it was time to start the dreaded school journey back up. My mentality summed up was pretty much "I started it so I should probably finish it".</p>
            <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">Fast forward to 2021, I attend Chattahoochee Technical College. It was there that I received my network specialist associate's degree. Afterwards, I transferred back to Kennesaw State University to achieve my Information Technology bachelor's. I have found myself in the position of retaking a lot of the classes that I failed when I dropped out. This is the journey that I chose to go on, I cannot wait until it is finished. </p>
